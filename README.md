# 👩‍💼 Employee Attrition Predictor using Machine Learning

## 💡 Project Overview

Employee attrition (voluntary or involuntary resignation) is a major concern in HR management.  
This project uses a machine learning model to predict whether an employee is likely to leave, based on various features like job satisfaction, years at company, work-life balance, etc.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict if an employee will leave the company or stay
- Help HR departments reduce turnover
- Provide actionable insights for retention strategies
